        ## Modularity

        Modularity is a measure used in network analysis to evaluate the strength of division of a network into communities or groups. It quantifies how well a network is organized into clusters, where connections (edges) are denser within groups (communities) than between them.

        ### Why is Modularity Important?

        - **Community Detection**: High modularity indicates that a network has distinct communities, making it easier to identify groups of nodes (such as authors) that collaborate more closely with each other than with nodes outside their group.
        - **Network Structure Insight**: Understanding the modularity of a network helps reveal its structure and can provide insights into the dynamics and interactions within the network.

        ### How is Modularity Calculated?

        Modularity (Q) is calculated using the following formula:

        # Display the text explanation

        # Display the modularity formula using st.latex
        st.latex(r"""
        Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i} \left( e_{ii} - \frac{k_i^2}{2m} \right)
        """)

        # Continue the explanation after the formula
        st.markdown("""
        Where:
        
        - $$ m $$ is the total number of edges in the network.
        - $$ e_{ii} $$ is the number of edges within community $$ i $$.
        - $$ k_i $$ is the total degree (number of connections) of nodes in community $$ i $$.

        ### Interpretation of Modularity Values

        - **Q = 0**: The network has no community structure; connections are random.
        - **Q > 0**: The network has communities. The higher the value, the stronger the community structure.
        - **0.3 < Q â‰¤ 0.5**: A moderate community structure.
        - **Q > 0.5**: A strong community structure, indicating well-defined groups.

        ## Community Detection

        The community detection algorithm used in this analysis is the Greedy Modularity Communities algorithm, which is based on maximizing the modularity of the network. It identifies communities by iteratively moving nodes between communities to improve the overall modularity score.

        ## Understanding Network Plot Below (from `networkx.spring_layout`)

        This network plot shows relationships (e.g., co-authorships) in a collaboration network. Here's how to interpret it:

        1. **Nodes (Circles)**:
        - Each circle represents a person (e.g., an author).
        - Larger or more prominently colored nodes indicate individuals with more connections.

        2. **Edges (Lines)**:
        - Lines show relationships (e.g., collaborations) between nodes.
        - Shorter lines connect closely related individuals or frequent collaborators.

        3. **Clusters**:
        - Groups of closely packed nodes represent communities or teams that collaborate frequently.
        - Distant clusters imply less interaction with the core of the network.

        4. **Key Figures**:
        - Labeled nodes are central figures with many connections, often the 'center' of the group.

        5. **Layout (Spring Layout)**:
        - The `networkx.spring_layout` algorithm places highly connected nodes close together.
        - Peripheral nodes are those with fewer connections to the central network.

        This plot reveals collaboration patterns, highlighting key individuals, core groups, and peripheral members in the network.
